# ENERGETIC

Scripts and instructions to run benchmarks used by UCL (initially and then further developed) for the [ENERGETIC project](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/research-software-opportunities/issues/670).

The directory structure is split by:

1. Facility
2. Benchmark
3. Hardware type (CPU, GPU, FPGA).
